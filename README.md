# Santa-Clara
This is my attempt in creating a software to solve math problems. This project is build on turbo C++ and Python. This is the beta version but this could very well be the final version if I get bored. I would recommend you to read ther documentation before using the software. There is a 64-bit exe and an exe file generated by turbo C++. Hope yoy like my project
