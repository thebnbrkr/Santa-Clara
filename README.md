# Santa-Clara-TurboC-
This is my attempt in creating a software to solve math problems. This project is build on turbo C++ and this is the beta version. This could very well be the final version if I get bored.

  Santa Clara
This is the user guide and documentation Santa Clara ver 0.85 (BETA). This software will remain in the beta stage until the developer changes his mind. This could very well be the final update as there is a high chance that the developer could move on with his/her other projects. This software is developed by "The Bnbrkr" and is published on Github under MIT license.
